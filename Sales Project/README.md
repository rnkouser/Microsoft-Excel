# Bike Buyers Excel Dashboard Project

This project involves creating an Excel dashboard to analyze a dataset of bike buyers. The process includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization within Excel.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Performed directly in Excel, including handling missing values and standardizing column names.
- **Data Transformation**: Applied formulas and pivot tables for data aggregation and analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed using Excel features such as slicers, charts, and conditional formatting to provide insights into bike purchase trends.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information about individuals, such as:
- **Demographics**: (age, marital status, gender, etc.)
- **Financial details**: (income, homeownership, etc.)
- **Bike purchase status**

## Steps

### Data Import

### Data Cleaning
- Standardized column headers.
- Filled missing values with appropriate defaults (e.g., average income for blanks).
- Ensured consistency in categorical values (e.g., "Yes/No" for binary fields).

### Data Transformation
- Created calculated columns (e.g., Income per child).
- Used Excel formulas and functions to derive insights.
- Aggregated data using Pivot Tables.

### Dashboard Creation
- Designed interactive visuals, including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
- Added slicers for filtering by region, marital status, and bike purchase status.
- Utilized conditional formatting to highlight key trends.
